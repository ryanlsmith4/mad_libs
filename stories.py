fresh_prince = '''Now this is the story all about how
My life got flipped, turned upside down
And Id like to take a minute just sit right there
Ill tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-air'''
fresh_prince1 = '''In west Philadelphia born and raised
On the playground where I spent most of my days
Chilling out, maxing, relaxing all cool
And all shooting some b-ball outside of the school
When a couple of guys, they were up to no good
Started making trouble in my neighbourhood
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
And said Youre moving with your auntie and uncle in Bel-air'''

fresh_prince2 = '''I whistled for a cab and when it came near the
License plate said fresh and had a dice in the mirror
If anything I could say that this cab was rare
But I thought nah, forget it, yo homes to Bel-air!'''

fresh_prince3 = '''I pulled up to a house about seven or eight
And I yelled to the cabby Yo, homes smell you later!
Looked at my kingdom I was finally there
To sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-air'''
